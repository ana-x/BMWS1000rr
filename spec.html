<font face="Lato" color="white" size="3">BMW S1000RR is a race oriented sport bike initially made by BMW Motorrad to compete in the 2009 Superbike World Championship, that is now in commercial production. 
It was introduced in Munich in April 2008, and is powered by a 999 cc (61.0 cu in) four-cylinder engine redlined at 14,200 rpm. 
BMW made 1,000 S1000RRs in 2009 to satisfy World Superbike homologation requirements, but expanded production for commercial sale of the bike in 2010. It has a standard anti-lock braking system, with an optional electronic traction control. 
As of 2016, it has a wet weight of 204 kg (450 lb), and produces 148.4 kW (199.0 hp; 201.8 PS) at 13,500 rpm. With 133.6 kW (179.2 hp; 181.6 PS) to the rear wheel, it was the most powerful motorcycle in the class on the dyno.
